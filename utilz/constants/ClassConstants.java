        public static final String BARBARIAN_DESC = "People of towns and cities take pride in their settled ways, as if denying one's connection to nature were a mark of " +
            "superiority. To a barbarian, though, a settled life is no virtue, but a sign of weakness. The strong embrace nature--valuing keen instincts, primal physicality, " +
            "and ferocious rage. Barbarians are uncomfortable when hedged in by walls and crowds. They thrive in the wilds of their homelands: the tundra, jungle, or " +
            "grasslands where their tribes live and hunt.Barbarians come alive in the chaos of combat. They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over, giving them " +
            "superhuman strength and resilience. A barbarian can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few times without resting, but those few rages are usually sufficient " +
            "to defeat whatever threats arise.";
        public static final String BARD_DESC = "To bards, words and music are not just vibrations of air, but vocalizations with power all their own. The bard is a master of " +
            "song, speech, and the magic they contain. Bards say that the multiverse was spoken into existence, that the words of the gods gave it shape, and that echoes of " +
            "these primordial Words of Creation still resound throughout the cosmos. The music of bards is an attempt to snatch and harness those echoes, subtly woven into " +
            "their spells and powers. The greatest strength of bards is their sheer versatility. Many bards prefer to stick to the sidelines in combat, using their magic to " +
            "inspire their allies and hinder their foes from a distance. But bards are capable of defending themselves in melee if necessary, using their magic to bolster " +
            "their swords and armor. Their spells lean toward charms and illusions rather than blatantly destructive spells. They have a wide-ranging knowledge of many subjects " +
            "and a natural aptitude that lets them do almost anything well. Bards become masters of the talents they set their minds to perfecting, from musical performance to " +
            "esoteric knowledge.";
        public static final String CLERIC_DESC = "Not every acolyte or officiant at a temple or shrine is a cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life of temple service, " +
            "carrying out their gods' will through prayer and sacrifice, not by magic and strength of arms. In some cities, priesthood amounts to a political office, viewed as a " +
            "stepping stone to higher positions of authority and involving no communion with a god at all. True clerics are rare in most hierarchies. When a cleric takes up an " +
            "adventuring life, it is usually because his or her god demands it. Pursuing the goals of the gods often involves braving dangers in unsettled lands, smiting evil, or " +
            "seeking holy relics in ancient tombs. Many clerics are also expected to protect their deities' worshipers, which can mean fighting enemy raiders, negotiating peace " +
            "between warring nations, or sealing a portal that would allow a demon prince to enter the world. Most adventuring clerics maintain some connection to established " +
            "temples and orders of their faiths. A temple might ask for a cleric's aid, or a high priest might be in a position to demand it.";
        public static final String DRUID_DESC = "Druids revere nature above all, gaining their spells and other magical powers either from the force of nature itself or from a " +
            "nature deity. Many druids pursue a mystic spirituality of transcendent union with nature rather than devotion to a divine entity, while others serve gods of wild " +
            "nature, animals, or elemental forces. The ancient druidic traditions are sometimes called the Old Faith, in contrast to the worship of gods in temples and shrines. " +
            "Druid spells are oriented toward nature and animals--the power of tooth and claw, of sun and moon, of fire and storm. Druids also gain the ability to take on animal " +
            "forms, and some druids make a particular study of this practice, even to the point where they prefer animal form to their natural form.";
        public static final String FIGHTER_DESC = "Fighters learn the basics of all combat styles. Every fighter can swing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a longsword or a " +
            "greatsword, use a bow, and even trap foes in a net with some degree of skill. Likewise, a fighter is adept with shields and every form of armor. Beyond that basic " +
            "degree of familiarity, each fighter specializes in a certain style of combat. Some concentrate on archery, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some on " +
            "augmenting their martial skills with magic. This combination of broad general ability and extensive specialization makes fighters superior combatants on battlefields " +
            "and in dungeons alike.";
        public static final String PALADIN_DESC = "A paladin swears to uphold justice and righteousness, to stand with the good things of the world against the encroaching " +
            "darkness, and to hunt the forces of evil wherever they lurk. Different paladins focus on various aspects of the cause of righteousness, but all are bound by the " +
            "oaths that grant them power to do their sacred work. Although many paladins are devoted to gods of good, a paladin's power comes as much from a commitment to justice " +
            "itself as it does from a god. Paladins train for years to learn the skills of combat, mastering a variety of weapons and armor. Even so, their martial skills are " +
            "secondary to the magical power they wield: power to heal the sick and injured, to smite the wicked and the undead, and to protect the innocent and those who join " +
